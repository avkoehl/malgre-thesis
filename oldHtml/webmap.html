    <p style="padding:20px">The tragic story of the Malgre-Nous; French men from Alsace and Moselle who were incorporated by force in the German Army during World War II, is relatively unknown and deserves to be told. More than 130,000 men were incorporated into the German Army this way and were sent to the Eastern Front. My work seeks to use dynamic geographic visualizations and interactive maps to reflect the fluid conditions of their experience and give a sense of the scale of their role in the overall conflict. Mapping their whereabouts and interpreting these maps will reveal novel elements towards an understanding of their motives, and their treatment. Their situation is problematic and paradoxical and often their history has been hidden. Through mapping I hope to shed new light on the narrative of the Malgre-Nous and highlight factors that were significant in their experience.</p>
